As weâ€™re embracing Information Age, data becomes so abundant that processing it is no easy business. Names and numbers: how does one make sense of them? In this project, you will be writing a program that processes textual and numeric data and sorts it nicely. Make it a truly talented program: enable it to determine the biggest or most frequent pieces of data and perform necessary calculations. Data is waiting to be sorted!
